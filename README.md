3. Add an API for the modernized application.

### Primary Benefits to Sponsor
1. Application performance.
2. Maintainability.
3. Commercialization opportunites (i.e.,domain logic access via API, or sale of domain as a library).

### Functionalities
The new application has a wide range of functionalities and features, including custom report generation, forecasting, and a full featured secure API built with support for data analytics. Ideas for potential Machine Learning applications were also developed.
